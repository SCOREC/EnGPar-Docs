\section{Artifact Description Appendix: 
Dynamic Load Balancing of Plasma and Flow Simulations}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Abstract}

Information is provided to create the vertex partitions of the Aeroelastic
Prediction Workshop mesh that are described in Section~\ref{sec:results} of the ScalA18
workshop paper titled ``Dynamic Load Balancing of Plasma and Flow Simulations''.
The meshes and graphs used for the vertical tail problem contain sensitive
design information that cannot be published at this time.

}

\subsubsection{How software can be obtained}

EnGPar is available on Github at {https://github.com/SCOREC/EnGPar}.
For reproducibility, we list the specific versions (via Git SHA1 hash) used for
the experiments.  

\begin{itemize}
  \item element-partitioned mesh (Section~\ref{sec:elmPtn}):
    \url{f6feb49cceea3d475ca3b66d318773fcb022e9e8}
  \item vertex-partitioned mesh (Section~\ref{sec:vtxPtn}):
    \url{246a25c51ad813408a0b1b95b1c3304ebbef374f}
  \item plasma simulation (Section~\ref{sec:pic}): 
    \url{5357ec528c878965006dfb8cfe0251e83a418b1a}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Hardware dependencies}

The experiments were performed on the IBM Blue Gene/Q at Argonne National
Laboratories and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's Center for Computational
Innovations.

\subsubsection{Software dependencies}

EnGPar depends on the following libraries:
\begin{itemize}
  \item ParMETIS 4.0.3 - initial partitioning
  \item PCU - peer-to-peer communications and non-blocking sparse neighborhood exchanges
  \item PUMI - load PUMI unstructured meshes and query them for (hyper)graph construction
\end{itemize}

A compatible version of PUMI and PCU is
\url{https://github.com/SCOREC/core/tree/b623e021a03fa29c548582222127cc669dc708a4}.

\subsubsection{Datasets}

The Zenodo dataset containing the input graphs of the Aeroelastic Prediction
Workshop mesh is available at \url{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1409558} .

\subsection{Installation}

For the CCI BGQ we load modules:
{\scriptsize
\begin{lstlisting}
module load cmake \
       gcc/4.7.2 \
       zoltan/gcc/4.7.2 \
       parmetis/gcc/4.7.2
\end{lstlisting}
}

To build EnGPar:
{\scriptsize
\begin{lstlisting}
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. \
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER="mpicc" \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="mpicxx" \
    -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-O2" \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-O2 -std=c++11" \
    -DENABLE_PARMETIS=ON \
    -DENABLE_PUMI=OFF \
    -DSCOREC_PREFIX=/path/to/core/install \
    -DBIG_ENDIAN=ON
make
\end{lstlisting}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Experiment workflow}

The script below was used to run EnGPar's diffusive load balancing on the vertex-partitioned mesh.
{\scriptsize
\begin{lstlisting}
#!/bin/sh
#SBATCH --job-name=BALANCE
#SBATCH -t 01:00:00
#SBATCH --partition medium
#SBATCH --nodes 512

engpar=/path/to/EnGPar/build/test
graph=/path/to/graphs/$1

srun --ntasks $2 -o balance/$1_$2_$3.out \
     $engpar/balance $graph/$2/ 1 1.05 1.05 $3
\end{lstlisting}
}

An example of running the script with 1024 processes and without the edge cut metric limit is:

{\scriptsize
\begin{lstlisting}
sbatch balance.sh aepw 1024
\end{lstlisting}
}

An example of running the script on the collapsed boundary layer graphs with 8192 processes and the edge cut metric limit set to 1.0 is:

{\scriptsize
\begin{lstlisting}
sbatch balance.sh aepw_collapsed 8192 1.0
\end{lstlisting}
}

\subsection{Evaluation and expected result}

Expected results are located in the 
\url{https://github.com/SCOREC/EnGPar-Docs/tree/master/scala18}
repo.
{\color{red} GD LINK TO SUBMITTED VERSION}

Plots of vertex and edge imbalances and edge cut are produced by
running the bash script \texttt{parseAndPlot.sh} in the
\texttt{plots/aepw\_edgeCut\_collapse\_results} directory.
GNUPlot is required for plotting.
