To plot results
./parseAndPlot.sh <trial number = 2/3> <"list of metric limits">

Trial 2 is the graph vtx=mesh vtx, graph edges = mesh elm
      limits = 1.2 1.0 0.8 0.5
Trial 3 is the graph vtx=mesh vtx, graph edges = mesh edges
      limits = 2.0 1.5 1.2 1.0

There should be no text output; only the .eps files written to disk.

## SCALA18
